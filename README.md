# Method *not* missing

By including the module `MethodNotMissing`, an object's `method_missing`
will be replaced by googling to rdoc and implemented on the
fly. Instance variables are added where missing and missing constants
are also declared on the fly.

There's some backtracking if the implementation found raises an error
(like stack overflows) or if a nested method lookup fails.

# Installation

```sh
gem install method_not_missing
```

## External dependencies
- PhantomJS ( `brew install phantomjs` on OSX )

# Warnings

This is insane.

# Example

```ruby
require "method_not_missing"

object = MethodNotMissing::OmnipotentObject.new
object.update([3])
## Googling...
#=> [3]
object.update([4])
#=> [3, 4]
object.inspect
#=> #<MethodNotMissing::OmnipotentObject:70308021738440 @uncounted=[3, 4]>
```

# Future work:

- Type Safety: since we get the arity of the requested function, we
  could filter out the ones with the wrong number of argument. This is
  implemented with exception-driven backtracking on ArgumentErrors
  right now.

- Enterprise
